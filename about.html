          <p>
            Since I was 17 years old, when I started my Professional journey in the oil and gas segment, I have acquired vast experience in the Operational area in Equipment and Tool Manufacturing Projects for Wireline, Gas Lift, Drilling, Coiltube and Completion, and Projects for Operational Planning for Subsea Equipment, operating in the last 15 years in national and multinational companies, consolidated in the market.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, when I entered the Masters in Production Engineering and Computational Systems, I discovered the fascinating world of Data Science. My academic experience made it possible to create algorithms using machine learning language to explore and make sense of the data and then use data visualization to present that data to decision makers. Thanks to my master's degree, I was invited, in 2020, to present my course conclusion work at the 40th International Symposium on Forecasting (ISF).
          </p>
          <p>
            Allied to this experience, I discovered how passionate I am about Data Science. From this passion I tried to specialize in this area. The Masters had already given me a great background, however, still wanting to acquire more knowledge and become a professional in this field of technology, I graduated in Data Scientist from the Data Science Academy.

          <p class="dark">
Thanks to my professional know-how as a Project Engineer, I have mastery in the manufacturing and inspection processes of equipment and tools (Wireline, Gas lift, Drilling, Coiltube and Completion), as well as in the Equipment Maintenance and Repair Planning processes Subsea, and Technical Support to the Sales and Customer Service sector. However, Data Science made it possible to add more value to my professional profile. Being another device in my troubleshooting toolbox.<br><b>
Today I can reconcile Project Engineering together with Data Science, providing the necessary techniques for any decision-making process.</b>
