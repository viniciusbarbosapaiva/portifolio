              <h3>Performance Analysis of Trading Rules Via Artificial Neural Networks in Trading Operations</h3>
              <p><b>Project Description:</b> This project proposes to measure the accuracy of the trading rule known as moving average crossover. For this task, the application of the Deep Artificial Neural Network (DNN) model based on the binary classification was proposed. The financial asset obtained for the research was the Mini U.S. Dollar Futures Contract, as of the second half of 2019. For the DNN model, 22 variables were defined. Among these: the closing price, opening price, maximum price and minimum price. Collected from a classification robot, such variables are input parameters for the proposed DNN architecture.</p>
              <p><b>Programming Language Used In The Project:</b> Python and MQL5.</p>
						  <p><b>Frameworks Used In The Project:</b> Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Warnings, Calendar, Seaborn, Sklearn, TensorFlow and Keras.</p>
              <p><b>Project Results:</b> The results discussed in this project were forwarded at the 40th International Forecasting Symposium (ISF) and Production Engineering Symposium (SIMEP). With the data and models used, the final results defined that the accuracy found for the trading rule of crossing moving averages, from the DNN model, presented a low percentage of prediction.</p>

              <h3>APP with Expert Advisor (Trading Robot) for Buy and Sell on Mini Ibovespa Futures and Mini U.S. Dollar Futures</h3>
              <p><b>Project Description:</b> Create an Expert Advisor in order to automate purchases and sales in the Mini Ibovespa Futures or Mini U.S. Dollar Futures in daytrade operations.</p>
              <p><b>Programming Language Used In The Project:</b> Python.</p>
              <p><b>Frameworks Used In The Project:</b> numpy, pandas, warnings, MetaTrader5, datetime, pytz, calendar, streamlit, matplotlib, Prophet and plot_plotly.</p>
              <p><b>Project Results:</b> <br><b>- Mini U.S. Dollar Futures:</b> Between 2021-01-01 and 2021-06-09, the model hit the trend 58.88% and missed 41.12%. According to the trend forecast carried out by the model, the strategy was to open a trade at 09:00:00 and close at 17:00, betting that the market would follow as expected. The end result was that by executing this strategy we get a total of 3073.5 points gained and 1193.0 points lost.<br>
              <b>- Mini Ibovespa Futures:</b> Between 2021-01-01 and 2021-06-09, the model hit the trend 63.55% and missed 36.45%. According to the forecast of the trend carried out by the model, the strategy was to open a trade at 09:00:00 and close at 17:00, betting that the market would follow as expected. The end result was that by executing this strategy we get a total of 73590.0 points gained and 38165.0 points lost.

              <h3>Automation of the Engineering Drawings Printing Process</h3>
              <p><b>Project Description:</b> It is the responsibility of the Surco Engineering sector to print drawings for the manufacture and assembly of equipment sold to various clients in the Oil and Gas sector. However, this process demands a lot of time from the responsible professional. Aiming at process optimization, the entire printing task was automated from start to finish by consulting a data source, where, in a way, all drawings are printed for all sectors without human interference.</p>
              <p><b>Programming Language Used In The Project:</b> Python.</p>
              <p><b>Frameworks Used In The Project:</b> pandas, datetime, PysimpleGUI, json, os, pyautogui, time and subprocess.</p>
              <p><b>Project Results:</b> Before automation, a qualified professional was needed to perform the task of printing drawings for the manufacturing and assembly of equipment. However, after automation, there is no need for a professional performing this function. Thus, it minimized the cost of qualified labor and allowed the professional to be allocated to other tasks.

              <h3>Automation of the Distribution Control of Engineering Drawings</h3>
              <p><b>Project Description:</b> According to the ISO 9001 standard, document control and review is a very important process for any company that seeks continuous improvement. In order to meet this, the Surco Engineering sector is responsible for controlling the drawings distributed for the manufacture and assembly of equipment sold to the various clients in the Oil and Gas sector. However, this process demands a lot of time from the responsible professional. Aiming at procedural optimization, the control task was all automated from start to finish by consulting a data source, where, in a way, all drawings are controlled without human interference.</p>
              <p><b>Programming Language Used In The Project:</b> Python.</p>
              <p><b>Frameworks Used In The Project:</b> pnumpy, pandas, datetime, PysimpleGUI, json, os, pyautogui, time and platforms.</p>
              <p><b>Project Results:</b> Before automation, a qualified professional was needed to perform the task of controlling the distribution of drawings for manufacturing and assembly of equipment. However, after automation, there is no need for a professional performing this function. Thus minimizing the cost of qualified labor and made it possible to allocate the professional to other tasks.
